If you want to use dhtmlxVault in a commercial product, you have to buy a commercial license. 
Please contact us at sales@dhtmlx.com

Some comments on commercial usage:

1.Commercial License allows you to use dhtmlxVault on unlimited number of Websites or sites 
but only in one commercial project(application). According to this license we provide you 
with support (consultations) and free-of-charge bug fixing during 1 month. 

2.Enterprise License allows you to use dhtmlxVault in unlimited number of projects on condition 
that all of them are projects of one company. Support period is 1 year. 


According to both licenses you are allowed to make changes to the code of Software but DHTMLX LTD 
still owns the code and you are not allowed to distribute changed code.
